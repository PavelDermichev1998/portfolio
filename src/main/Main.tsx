                        using React, Redux, Typescript, HTML, CSS, JS seeking a position in an IT position which will make
                        possible the use of professional and technical skills developed through past work experiences in this
                        field. I'm always looking forward to improve my expertise. My free time is dedicated to Codewars to
                        improve my programming skills. In addition, I prefer boosting my English expanding my vocabulary by
                        reading texts that are relevant to my work. My next focus is to become a Full-Stack Developer thatâ€™s
                        why I also intend to learn Node.js. Ready to consider project work and full-time employment.
